      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className='text-justify'>
        As a skilled front-end software engineer, I bring over 6 years of experience in the software
        development industry, partnering with scrum teams to achieve organizational and personal
        goals. My expertise lies in web and mobile (hybrid) development with cutting-edge
        technologies, and I am highly skilled in one of the most popular Javascript frameworks,
        Angular. In my quest to continuously improve myself as a professional and as an individual,
        I am always seeking out new skills and knowledge that can enhance both my personal and
        professional life. I'm a passionate programmer, and enjoy reading and playing video games
        with friends in my spare time. When it comes to programming, I thrive on competition and
        always give my best. I am a forward-thinking, collaborative team player who is dedicated to
        achieving success both individually and as part of a team. My goal is to leverage my skills
        and expertise to help organizations drive digital transformation, and to continue to grow
        both personally and professionally. In addition to my skills in web and mobile development,
        I am also deeply interested in game development. I am fascinated by the process of creating
        immersive and engaging experiences that can transport players to new worlds and challenge
        their skills. As a software engineer, I believe that my expertise and passion can be applied
        to create innovative and exciting games. I look forward to exploring opportunities in this
        field and continuing to grow my skills in game development.
